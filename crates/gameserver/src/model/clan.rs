//! Clans — the G11 creation/display slice of Java's `model/clan/Clan` +

//! crests/wars/sub-pledges are later milestones (fields exist where the
//! packets need a zero to write). Loaded once at boot (`DbEvent::
//! ClansLoaded`), mutated only by `game_loop/clans.rs`.

/// One `clan_members`-equivalent row — Java reads members from `characters
/// WHERE clanid=?`; this snapshot carries what the pledge packets show.
